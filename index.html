        <p>The International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Science for Scientific and Industrial Applications will focus on topics of interest to computer and computational scientists and engineers. ICMLDSSIA 2025 is to bring together leading academic, scientists, research scholars and researchers to share and exchange their experiences and research results about all aspects of Machine Learning and Data Science for Scientific & Industrial Applications. It would also provide a premier interdisciplinary forum for researchers and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, concerns, practical challenges encountered and the solutions adopted in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science. The conference aims to enhance the state-of-the-art in Machine Learning and Data Science, as well as other emerging fields of computing, by innovative research discoveries and inventive solutions to tough machine learning challenges and their industrial applications. Researchers, academicians, and professionals from around the globe are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers from all perspectives, including theory, practice, experimentation, and review papers that highlighting specific research domains for presentation during the conference's technical sessions.</p>

            <h1>Department of Mathematical Sciences And Computer Application </h1>
            <p>The world is dynamic and continuous to change. New challenges opportunities and hopes are things that inherit. A fighting spirit, a nationalistic spirit, and a unifying spirit from our predecessors, who paved the way for us regained and defined the independence where we are enjoying today. In a new era, filled with hopes and changes with political, scientific, and technological and information advancement, in the era of open global economy and free trade, we too must continue to preserve the fighting spirit, the nationalistic spirit and unifying spirit. Education is the key to overall development of the society; Education is one of the investments, which multiplies the dividends as unending process. The department of Mathematical Sciences and Computer Applications, established in 1986, is one of the oldest departments of the University and within a small span of time; the department has shown its potentiality and has diversified its teaching and research programs in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science & Information Technology. The department has made considerable progress by responding to the emerging needs of the society, by widening the canvas of higher education and by affecting qualitative improvements in its academic and research programs. At present the department is offering number of courses and catering to the multifarious needs of nearly 1000 students. Besides this, the department is also actively engaged in research programs in Mathematical Sciences, Statistics, Computer Sciences and Information Technology. The accelerated growth all around expansion of the department, in the last decade stands as success story of such devoted efforts. Faculty to faculty and faculty to studentâ€™s relationship are the assets of the department.</p>
